# 🐾 Multi-Class Animal Recognition using Deep Learning

This project is part of the **Green Skill Internship Program** by **EDUNET Foundation in collaboration with AICTE**, focusing on building a deep learning-based solution for recognizing multiple animal species from images. The model classifies input images into various animal categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## 📌 Project Description

The **Multi-Class Animal Recognition** project aims to:
- Train a deep learning model to accurately classify images of animals into multiple categories.
- Utilize a CNN architecture for high-accuracy feature extraction and classification.
- Create a practical, scalable, and beginner-friendly solution suitable for real-time image recognition tasks.

This project was developed using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**, and runs in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Manual identification of animal species is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in fields like wildlife research, conservation, and veterinary science. Automating this process can enhance speed and accuracy, supporting large-scale analysis and monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and augment animal image data.
- Build and train a CNN model.
- Evaluate model performance on training and testing data.
- Achieve high accuracy in multi-class classification.
- Provide a simple and deployable solution.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple animal classes stored in separate directories, with each class representing one animal species. Image augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

> *Note: Dataset should be downloaded and placed in the `datasets/` directory as referenced in the notebook.*

## 🧱 Model Architecture

The model uses a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture consisting of:
- Convolutional layers
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification

## 📈 Results

- The model achieves high accuracy (>90% in most cases) depending on dataset quality and augmentation.
- Training and validation metrics show effective learning and generalization.
